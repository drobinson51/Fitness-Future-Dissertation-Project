NPM install in the git repository after extracting it, this will allow you to run the project once it acquires the files. 
This default root is by default ./fitness-web-app.

Go to the src folder and run "node server" to get the database working, 
Make sure your database is running and is set to work with the database conditions of the server, i.e. use my fitnessapp.sql,
and handle it with your DB manager of choice

NPM start and the front-end will launch. You are now capable of using the project as intended.
